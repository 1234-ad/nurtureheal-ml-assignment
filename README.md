### 📈 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 82.12% | 78.95% | 75.00% | 76.92% |
| Decision Tree | 78.77% | 73.68% | 70.00% | 71.79% |
| Random Forest | 82.68% | 81.58% | 77.50% | 79.49% |
| SVM | 81.56% | 78.95% | 75.00% | 76.92% |

**Best Model**: Random Forest (after hyperparameter tuning)
- **Optimized Accuracy**: 83.24%
- **Best Parameters**: n_estimators=100, max_depth=7, min_samples_split=5

### 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Gender Impact**: Female passengers had 74% survival rate vs 19% for males
2. **Class Effect**: 1st class passengers had 63% survival rate vs 24% for 3rd class
3. **Age Factor**: Children had higher survival rates than adults
4. **Family Size**: Passengers with small families (2-4 members) had better survival rates

### 🌐 Web Application Features

- **Interactive Form**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting passenger details
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant survival probability calculations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **API Access**: RESTful endpoint for programmatic predictions
